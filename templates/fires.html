      <h2>How to Prepare for a Fire</h2>
      <p>Preparing for a fire in California is essential to ensure the safety of yourself, your loved ones, and your
        property. The threat of wildfires in the state is a reality that requires proactive measures and careful
        planning. Here are some crucial steps to take in order to prepare for a fire and understand its potential
        impact:
      </p>
      <h3>1. Stay Informed:</h3>
      <p>
        Keep yourself updated on current fire conditions, warnings, and evacuation orders by monitoring local news,
        official websites, and emergency alerts. Sign up for your community's emergency notification systems to receive
        timely information.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Create an Emergency Plan:</h3>
      <p>

        Develop a detailed emergency plan that includes evacuation routes, meeting points, and contact information for
        family members. Discuss and practice the plan with everyone in your household to ensure everyone knows what to
        do in case of a fire.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Prepare an Emergency Kit:</h3>
      <p>

        Assemble an emergency kit with essential supplies, including non-perishable food, water, a first aid kit,
        medications, flashlights, batteries, important documents, cash, and a portable phone charger. Keep the kit in an
        easily accessible location.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Protect Your Property:</h3>

      <p>
        Create defensible space around your home by removing flammable materials such as dry leaves, dead vegetation,
        and fallen branches. Trim trees and bushes, and keep your gutters clean. Use fire-resistant materials when
        building or renovating your property.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Secure Important Documents:</h3>

      <p>
        Keep copies of important documents, such as identification papers, insurance policies, and property records, in
        a fireproof and waterproof container. Consider storing digital copies in a secure cloud-based service.
      </p>
      <h3>6. Review Insurance Coverage:</h3>

      <p>
        Ensure that your homeowner's insurance policy provides adequate coverage for fire damage. Understand the terms
        and exclusions of your policy, and consider obtaining additional coverage if necessary.
      </p>
      <h3>7. Pack a "Go Bag":</h3>

      <p>
        Prepare a "go bag" with essential items you may need to grab quickly during an evacuation. Include items like
        clothing, toiletries, important medications, and a portable radio.
      </p>
      <h3>8. Stay Vigilant and Practice Fire Safety:</h3>

      <p>
        Follow fire safety guidelines and regulations. Avoid activities that may cause sparks or fires, such as using
        fireworks or outdoor grills during dry periods. Be cautious with campfires and properly extinguish them before
        leaving.
      </p>
      <h3>9. Understand the Impact:</h3>

      <p>
        Be aware of how a fire can affect you physically, emotionally, and financially. Wildfires can cause the loss of
        homes, displacement, poor air quality, and stress. Stay connected with support networks, reach out for help if
        needed, and seek assistance from local resources and relief organizations.

        <br>
        <p>The prediction of the total area of fire burning in 2025 was calculated using a linear regression model
          trained
          on historical data. The model analyzed the relationship between the year and the total area burned in previous
          years. Based on this analysis, it estimated the total area of fire burning in 2025. The prediction provides
          valuable insights for planning and mitigating fire incidents in the future.</p>

        <p>This map analyzed data on locations that experienced the most acreages burned during the years 2015 to 2017.
          The above map identify hotspots or areas with higher fire vulnerability, allowing authorities or relevant
          stakeholders to prioritize fire prevention and management efforts in those locations. By focusing on areas
          that have experienced significant acreages burned in the past, it becomes possible to mitigate risks and
          enhance fire preparedness in these regions to minimize potential damages and loss of natural resources in the
          future.</p>
